Chess::Position::Tutorial - An Introductory Tutorial to Chess Programming in
Perl With C<Chess::Position>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Let's start by explaining the fundamental data structures.

=head2 Data Structures

=head3 Bitboards

A real chess board looks roughly likes this:

      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  8 | r | n | b | q | k | b | n | r |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  7 | p | p | p | p | p | p | p | p |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  6 |   | . |   | . |   | . |   | . |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  5 | . |   | . |   | . |   | . |   |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  4 |   | . |   | . |   | . |   | . |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  3 | . |   | . |   | . |   | . |   |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  2 | P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  1 | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h

The board has eight columns, called "files", named "a" to "h", and eight
rows, called "ranks", named "1" to "8". The initial position of the
white king "K" is "e1", the intersection of the "e" file and the "1"st
rank. Likewise, the white queen "Q" is on "d1", and the black king "k"
and black queen "q" are initially located on "e8" and "d8" respectively.

It is, of course, possible to use an intuitive board representation like
an array of arrays or even a hash, and there are chess libraries that do
exactly that. The main drawback of this approach is performance because
all operations on the board imply expensive lookups and dereferencings.

A more efficient representation takes advantage of the fact that a chess
board has exactly 64 squares. Nowadays, most computers use integers of
size 64. Therefore you can represent a chess board, more exactly one single
aspect of a chess board, as a 64-bit integer, each bit representing
exactly one square of the board.

But with just one bit of information per square, you cannot represent a
chess position, because there are 12 different pieces: Pawns, knights,
bishops, rooks, queens, and kings in both black and white. The solution
is to use multiple such bitboards, and combine them.

A C<Chess::Position> instance is an array of arrays of integers, and the
first few are:

=over

=item * C<w_pieces> - one bitboard for the white pieces

=item * C<b_pieces> - one bitboard for the black pieces

=item * C<pawns> - one bitboard for the pawns (of both colors)

=item * C<knights> - one bitboard for the knights (of both colors)

=item * C<bishops> - one bitboard for the bishops (of both colors)

=item * C<rooks> - one bitboard for the rooks (of both colors)

=item * C<queens> - one bitboard for the queens (of both colors)

=item * C<checkers> - one bitboard for all pieces giving check (of the color
not to move)

=item * C<kings> - one bitboard for the kings (of both colors)

=back

Why is there no distinction between black and white pieces of a certain
kind, for example black knights and white knights? The answer is
performance and compactness. To get a bitboard with one bit set for each
black knight, you simple do the bitwise AND of the two bitboards:

    $black_knights = $b_pieces & $knights

In other words: For each black knight, there must be one bit set in the
bitboard of black pieces AND in the knight bitboard.

Example: How to get a bitboard of white's regular (bishops, knights,
rooks, and queens) pieces:

    $w_pieces & ($knights | $bishops | $rooks | $queens)

A lot of libraries do not use a separate bitboard for queens because the moves
that a queen can make are just a superset of the moves of a bishop and the
moves of a rook.  Having no bitboard for queens, can therefore speed up parts
of the move generation but on the other hand requires a lot of extra
branching (conditionals).  In the case of L<Chess::Position> it turned out
that it is actually faster with a separate bitboard for the queens.

=head3 Other Board Representations

=head4 Forsyth-Edwards Notation FEN

The Forsyth-Edwards Notation of a chess position is mostly used for data
exchange between chess software. See for example
L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation>
for details.

=head4 Extended Position Description EPD

A similar notation to FEN is the L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Position_Description>.
You can think of it as FEN with meta data.

=head3 Coordinates and Squares

The chess board is actually a Cartesian coordinate system. There are
multiple ways, how a particular point in that coordinate system can be
specified. In C<Chess-Position> we use the terms "coordinates",
"squares", and "shifts", and you can convert between all of them with
dedicated class methods:

=over

=item C<my $square = Chess::Position-E<gt>coordinatesToSquare($file, $rank)>

=item C<my $shift = Chess::Position-E<gt>coordinatesToShift($file, $rank)>

=item C<my $shift = Chess::Position-E<gt>squareToShift($square)>

=item C<my ($file, $rank) = Chess::Position-E<gt>squareToCoordinates($square)>

=item C<my $square = Chess::Position-E<gt>shiftToSquare($shift)>

=item C<my ($file, $rank) = Chess::Position-E<gt>shiftToCoordinates($shift)>

=back

Additionally, we also have "shift masks" (see below).

=head4 Coordinates

When we talk of coordinates, we mean a pair of a file and a rank, but
always as 0-based indexes. So the files "a" to "h" are indexed as
0 ... 7, and the ranks "1" to "8" are indexed as 0 ... 7.

=head4 Squares

Squares are conventional coordinates like "e4" or "c7". They are only
used for presentational purposes.

=head4 Shifts

A bitboard has 64 bits, and each bit stands for a particular square of
the chess board:

       a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
    8 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 8
    7 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 7
    6 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 6
    5 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 5
    4 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 4
    3 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 3
    2  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 2
    1  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 1
       a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h

So the square "e4" is represented by the bit with the index 28 of a
bitboard (actually the 29th bit if you count from 1). So, a better term
may actually be "index" or "bit number".

But you do not have to remember the mapping. Instead just use the constants
C<CP_A1> for "a1", C<CP_A2> for "a2" and so on.

=head4 Shift Masks

How would you find out whether the square "e4" is occupied by a white
piece? You create a bitboard (64-bit integer) where only the 28th bit is
set and AND that with the bitboard of the white pieces. And you create a
bitboard where only the 28th bit is set with a shift operation:

    $e4_square = (1 << 28) | $w_pieces

You "shift" the one 28 places to the left. And this is why the indexes
or bit numbers are called "shifts" here. And a shift mask is a bitboard
with exactly one bit set.

The code will be better understandable if you replace the literal 28 with a
constant:

    $e4_square = (1 << CP_E4) | $w_pieces

=head3 C<Chess::Position> Instances

Unlike most Perl objects, instances of C<Chess::Position> are blessed
array references. This design decision was taken because accessing
accessing array elements is faster than accessing hash elements. But
there is no need to remember the exact ordering of the array. You can
either use dedicated macros that operate directly on
C<Chess::Position> instances or use constants for the indexes:

 use Chess::Position (:all);
 use Chess::Position::Macro;
 
 $pos = Chess::Position->new;
 
 # Equivalent!
 $w_pieces = $pos[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES];
 $pos[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES] = $_pieces;
 $w_pieces = cp_pos_white_pieces $pos;
 cp_pos_white_pieces $pos = $w_pieces;

=head3 Pieces

The chess pieces are specified by an enumeration:

=over

=item * C<CP_NO_PIECE> 0

=item * C<CP_PAWN> 1

=item * C<CP_KNIGHT> 2

=item * C<CP_BISHOP> 3

=item * C<CP_ROOK> 4

=item * C<CP_QUEEN> 5

=item * C<CP_KING> 6

=back

The default values for each piece are defined by these constants in
C<Chess::Position>:

=over

=item * C<CP_PAWN_VALUE> 100

=item * C<CP_KNIGHT_VALUE> 300

=item * C<CP_BISHOP_VALUE> 300

=item * C<CP_ROOK_VALUE> 500

=item * C<CP_QUEEN_VALUE> 900

=back

These constants can be overridden in derived classes. This is not
recommended for the constants specifiying the pieces (see above), as the
data values will not fit into the other structures.

=head3 Moves

=head4 Internal Move Representation

A move in C<Chess::Position> is simply an integer. The individual bits of a
move are:

=over

=item * 16-18 (15-17): piece that moves (resp. piece)

=item * 13-15 (12-14): promotion piece

=item * 7-12 (6-11): from shift (0-63)

=item * 1- 6 (0- 5): to shift (0-63)

=back

I<The numbers in parentheses are the 0-based bit numbers.>

Only bits 1 to 15 are really needed to characterize a move, and the bits
13 to 15 are only needed for pawn promotions. The other bits can be
derived from the position that the move is applied to.

The piece that moves, the piece is the piece that stands on the
starting square.  Note that this is never C<CP_QUEEN> even if the piece that
moves is a queen.  It is either C<CP_BISHOP> or C<CP_ROOK> for queen moves,
depending on how the queen moves.  This is a little bit confusing but has a
marginal performance advantage.

You do not have to remember the exact structure of a move but use macros
resp. inline functions for accessing individual properties:

=over

=item * C<cp_move_to($move)>: the starting square as a shift

=item * C<cp_move_from($move)>: the destination square as a shift

=item * C<cp_move_promotion($move)>: the promotion piece

=item * C<cp_move_piece($move)>: the attacking piece

=back

None of these macros can be used as l-values (on the left-hand side of
an assignment)! For this, use other macros:

=over

=item * C<cp_move_set_to($move, $to)>: the starting square as a shift

=item * C<cp_move_set_from($move, $from)>: the destination square as a shift

=item * C<cp_move_set_promotion($move, $piece)>: the promotion piece

=item * C<cp_move_set_piece($move, $piece)>: the attacking piece

=back

=head4 Parsing Moves

The method C<parseMove()> can be used for creating a move.  It expects the
move in either:

=over 4

=item Coordinate Notation

=item Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)

=back

The coordinate notation is the notation that most chess engines use.  It is
simply the start and the destination square appended plus an optional piece
to promote a pawn to, for example "b1c3" for the piece on square "b1" moving
to "c3" or "e7d8q" for a pawn on "e7" capturing the piece on "d8" being promoted
to a queen.

Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) is the notation conventionally used for
describing chess games. You will find more information about it on the internet.

Note that the move parser is very forgiving and accepts a lot of moves that
are not complying with the standard.

=head4 Making Moves Human-Readable

The methods C<SAN> and C<moveCoordinateNotation> can be used to print a move in
humand-readable format:

    $pos->SAN($move);
    # Nxe7#
    $pos->moveCoordinateNotation($move);
    # d6e7

In general, you will prefer print moves in Standard Algebraic Notation.

=head2 Using Macros

When dealing with chess programming you often find yourself executing
small operations many times, more than often millions of times. You can,
of course, write subroutines for these operations but the calling
overhead sums up and contributes significantly to the execution time of
your code.

Even writing these routines in C does not help at all because the
calling overhead is large compared to the execution time of the function
body.

This is why the module C<Chess::Position::Macro> exists. It makes a lot
of small helper functions available, the names of which all begin with
C<cp_>. You can use them more or less like functions but they are inlined
into your code at compile-time.

But this is only necessary, when performance is important. For normal
purposes, you can just use regular instance methods instead of macros.

But when you want to use the macros, there are a couple of caveats that you
have to keep in mind:

=head3 Use C<Chess::Position::Macro> and(!) C<Chess::Position>

The macros in C<Chess::Position::Macro> make use of constants defined in
C<Chess::Position>. If you do not import these constants, you will get
strange errors. You should therefore start your own code with this
boilerplate:

 use strict;
 use integer;
 use Chess::Position qw(:all);
 use Chess::Position::Macro;

=head3 Use C<integer>

Some of the macros will only work on integers. You must therefore always
C<use integer> in the scope of your code.  Not doing so will result in
errors!

If you need floating point arithmetics, activate them only in the limited
scope of a block:

    {
        no integer;
        printf "avg. loss in centipedes: %g\n", $score / 100;
    }

=head3 Do not Create References to Macros

Macros are not Perl subroutines. They are more or less stupidly replaced
with chunks of code. Things like C<my $sub = \&cp_pos_white_pieces> may or
may not cause a syntax error but they will never do what you expect.

=head3 Be Prepared for Errors

The macro expansion internally makes use of C<PPI::Document> and it
therefore shares all of that module's inevitable limitations. And it
adds a fair amount of its own shortcomings. The macro approach is rather
an experiment than a production-ready general-purpose tool.

=head2 Common Bitboard Operations

Bitboards are fast and efficient but working with them is a little bit
convoluted compared to more conventional representations of a chess
board like two-dimensional arrays or hashes.

=head3 Counting Pieces

Task: Count the number of white pawns on the board.

 use Chess::Position;
 use Chess::Position::Macro;
 
 my $pos = Chess::Position->new;
 my $white_pawns = cp_pos_white_pieces($pos) & cp_pos_pawns($pos);
 my $count;
 cp_bitboard_popcount $white_pawns, $count;
 print "There are $count white pawns on the board.\n";

The important line is the last but one. The macro C<cp_bitboard_popcount>
counts the number of bits set in an integer, and this is exactly what
you need here.

=head3 Iterating Bitboards

Task: Print the square for every white pawn on the board.

=head4 Conventional and Slow Approach

Iterating over a bitboard can be done in an intuitive and straightforward way:

    use integer;
    use Chess::Position qw(:all);
    use Chess::Position::Macro;

    my $white_pawn_mask = cp_pos_white_pieces($pos) & cp_pos_pawns($pos);

    foreach my $shift (0 .. 63) {
        my $shift_mask = 1 << $shift;

        if ($shift_mask & $white_pawn_mask) {
            my $square = cp_shift_to_square $shift;
            print "There is a white pawn on $square.\n";
         }
    }

You basically shift a 1 bit subsequently to the left, and then test whether the
corresponding bit is set in the bitboard.  There is nothing wrong with this
approach and it is actually reasonably fast.

=head4 Efficient and Fast Approach

But there is a another technique that achieves the same result and is often
faster:

    use integer;
    use Chess::Position qw(:all);
    use Chess::Position::Macro;

    my $pos = Chess::Position->new;
    my $white_pawn_mask = cp_pos_white_pieces($pos) & cp_pos_pawns($pos);

    while ($white_pawn_mask) {
        my $shift = cp_bitboard_count_trailing_zbits $shift_mask;

        my $square = cp_shift_to_square $shift;
        print "There is a white pawn on $square.\n";

        $white_pawn_mask = cp_bitboard_clear_least_set $white_pawn_mask;
    }

If you count the trailing zero bits with the macro
C<cp_bitboard_count_trailing_zbits()> you get the position of that bit in the
bitboard and you can now use that information for whatever you want to do.

At the end of the loop body, you clear the least significant bit of the
bitboard.  Therefore, the population count of the bitboard decreases by
one with each iteration.

If you want to benchmark both approaches, make sure to remove the expensive
operations inside the loop body, that is the call to C<cp_shift_to_square()>
and especially the print to the console.

What you will find out is that the second approach runs around 10-15 %
faster than the conventional approach.  On the one hand you have less
iterations (8 vs. 64) but masking out the bits and especially counting the
trailing zero bits outweighs that mostly.

But if you replace "pawn" with "king" in the code, the 2nd variation runs
around 700 % or seven times faster than the conventional approach.  This is
because you always have exactly one loop iteration instead of 64.  And in
the case of kings you could improve that even further by taking advantage of
the fact that there is always exactly one white king on the board.  So you
do not even need a loop.

Most of the time, the bitboards you are dealing with are sparsely populated
and it is advantageous to take the second approach.  Only in the exceptional
case that you want to iterate over a bitboard with all pieces of one color
or even all pieces of both colors, you are better off using the conventional
approach.

=head2 Game Play

=head3 Initializing a Position

You use the constructor to instantiate a chess position.  For the start
position you call it with arguments.  If you have the position represented
as a string in Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) you pass that as an
argument to the constructor:

    $pos = Chess::Position->new;

    # Or:

    $fen = 'r4rk1/1p3pp1/1q2b2p/1B2R3/1Q2n3/1K2PN2/1PP3PP/7R w - - 3 22';
    $pos = Chess::Position->new($fen);

=head3 Making Moves

Applying a move to a position usually requires first parsing a chess move
as a string into the internal representation.  You then pass that move
(which is just an integer) to the method C<doMove()>:

    # Parse the move in one of the supported formats.
    $move = $pos->parseMove('Nc3');
    $move = $pos->parseMove('Nb1-c3');
    $move = $pos->parseMove('b1c3');
    $state = $pos->doMove($move) or die "illegal move";

The method C<doMove()> returns a reference to an array containing state
information needed to undo the move later.  If the move was illegal,
the method returns a falsy value.

=head3 Undoing Moves

You will often find that you have to undo a move so that the position is
reverted to the state before the move had been played.

In general, there are two strategies for undoing moves in chess software.
The brute force approach is to make a deep copy of the position and revert
by copying back later, resp. by simply applying the move to the copy only and
throw it away.

The other possibility is to undo all modifications makde by applying the
move.  This is, of course, more complicated but often faster than the brute
force approach.

L<Chess::Position> supports both approaches and currently the brute force
approach seems to be faster (around 10-15 percent) but this maybe depends on
the hardware or system.  The reason for that is that a shallow copy is
sufficient for copying a L<Chess::Position> which makes the copying really
cheap, whereas undoing a move programmatically requires several dereferencings.

But you are encouraged to try it out yourself.

=head4 Undoing Moves Programmatically

This is done with C<undoMove()>:

    $state = $pos->doMove($move);
    $pos->undoMove($move, $state);

Not all recovery information can be stored in the move itself.  Therefore,
you have to pass the state information return from C<doMove()> as the
second argument to C<undoMove()>.

=head4 Undoing Moves By Copying the Position

How you do this depends a little bit on your exact requirements.  It will
probably look something like this:

    $copy = bless [@$pos], 'Chess::Position'; # or $copy = $pos->copy;
    $pos->do_move($move);

There is also a copy constructor C<copy()> but when you are really concerned
about performance, then you probably choose the manual copying because it
safes you a method call.

=head3 Playing Games in PGN Format

Playing games stored in Portable Game Notation PGN can be done with the
external library L<Chess::PGN::Parse>.  Note that a PGN file can actually
contain a collection of games, not just one:

    $pos = Chess::Position->new;
    $pgn = Chess::PGN::Parse->new('games.pgn') or die;
    while ($pgn->read_game) {
        $pgn->parse_game;
        @san_moves = $pgn->moves;
        foreach my $san_move (@san_moves) {
            $move = $pos->parseMove($san_move)
                or die "cannot parse move '$san_move'";
            $pos->doMove($move)
                or die "illegal move '$san_move'";
        }
    }

=head2 Analyzing Positions

L<Chess::Position> offers some high-level methods for analyzing chess
positions.

=head3 Listing Possible Moves

You have to ways to do this:

    @moves = $pos->legalMoves;
    foreach $move (@moves) {
        print join '|', $pos->SAN($move), $pos->moveCoordinateNotation($move);
    }

Chess engines usually do not try out every legal move for each position but
prune parts of the search tree by discarding moves which do not make sense.
Therefore, the move generator in L<Chess::Position> works in two stages.
The above example could be re-written like this:

    @moves = $pos->pseudoLegalMoves;
    foreach $move (@moves) {
        $pos->doMove($move) or next;
        $pos->undoMove($move);
        print join '|', $pos->SAN($move), $pos->moveCoordinateNotation($move);
    }

The method C<pseudoLegalMoves> may return moves that violate the rules of
chess.  But checking the rules is somewhat expensive.  If the loop above
may be exited early (this will often happen in chess engines), then these
extra checks are a waste of time, when you never actually consider the move.

What exactly is a pseudo-legal move is implementation dependent and you should
not rely on the current implementation.

=head3 Visualizing Bitboards

A bitboard, which is just a 64 bit integer, can be visualized in a
chess-board-like manner with C<dumpBitboard()>.

    print "white pieces: ", $pos->dumpBitboard($pos->[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES]);

There is also a method C<dumpAll()> which dumps all bitboards at once.

=head3 Checking for Check

Finding out whether the side to move is in check, can be done like this:

    $checkers = $pos->[CP_POS_IN_CHECK];
    # or: $checkers = cp_pos_in_check $pos;
    if ($checkers) {
        print "pieces giving check: ", $pos->dumpBitboard($checkers);
    }

In fact, what you get is not a boolean flag but a bitboard with the pieces
that are giving check.

=head3 Checking for Pieces

Finding out whether a white piece is on "e4" can be done like this:

    $shift = $pos->squareToShift('e4');
    # or $shift = $pos->coordinatesToShift(4, 0); 
    $mask = 1 << $shift;
    $is_white = $mask & $pos->[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES];
    # or: $is_white = $mask & cp_pos_white_pieces($pos);

If you want to know whether it is a white king, you go like this:

    $is_king = $mask & ($pos->[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES] & $pos->[CP_POS_KINGS]);
    # or: $is_king = $mask & (cp_pos_white_pieces($pos) & cp_pos_kings($pos));

For bishops, queens, and rooks, you have to keep in mind that there is no
bitboard for queens:

    $is_queen = $mask & cp_pos_bishops($pos) & cp_pos_rooks($pos);
    $is_rook = $mask & ~cp_pos_bishops($pos) & cp_pos_rooks($pos);
    $is_bishop = $mask & cp_pos_bishops($pos) & ~cp_pos_rooks($pos);

If you want to also check for the color, you additionally have to do the
bitwise AND of the white or black bitboard.

Finding out which piece is on a particular location can be done with
dedicated methods:

    ($piece, $color) = $pos->pieceAtSquare('e4');
    ($piece, $color) = $pos->pieceAtCoordinates(4, 3);
    ($piece, $color) = $pos->pieceAtShift(27);
    $piece = $pos->pieceAtSquare('e4');
    $piece = $pos->pieceAtCoordinates(4, 3);
    $piece = $pos->pieceAtShift(27);

In array context, you get the piece and the color, in scalar context just the
piece.  The piece is one of C<CP_PAWN>, C<CP_KNIGHT>, C<CP_BISHOP>,
C<CP_QUEEN>, or C<CP_KING>, and the color one of C<CP_WHITE>, C<CP_BLACK>,
or C<undef> if there is no piece at all at the specified location.

=head3 Castling State

The castling state is encoded with other state information in one single
integer as a bit mask.  It is highly recommended that you use the macros
from L<Chess::Position::Macro> for it:

    $white_can_castle_king_side  = cp_pos_white_king_side_castling_right $pos;
    $white_can_castle_queen_side = cp_pos_white_queen_side_castling_right $pos;
    $black_can_castle_king_side  = cp_pos_black_king_side_castling_right $pos;
    $black_can_castle_queen_side = cp_pos_black_queen_side_castling_right $pos;

=head3 En Passant

You should also use a macro from L<Chess::Position::Macro>:

    $en_passant_shift = cp_pos_en_passant_shift $pos;

This will be 0 if capturing en passant is not possible in the particular
position.  You may have to be careful to use this information because 0 is
also the "shift" for the square "h1".  In doubt, go like this:

    $ep_shift = cp_pos_en_passant_shift $pos;
    if ($ep_shift && $ep_shift == $location) {
        # do what you need ...
    }

=head3 Evading a Check

A check can be defended in one of three ways:

=over 4

=item Moving the King

This is always an option.

=item Capturing the Piece Giving Check

This is only an option if there is just one piece giving check (because you
cannot capture multiple pieces at once).

=item Blocking the Check With a Piece

You can also block the check by moving a piece between the king and the
opponent's piece giving check.  But this is not an option if multiple pieces
give check, or if the piece giving check is a queen, a rook, or a knight.

Why? If the piece giving check is a pawn, there is no space between it and
the king, and a knight can jump over other pieces.

=back

This information is always stored in a L<Chess::Position> object:

    $evasion_strategy = cp_pos_evasion $pos;
    } if (CP_EVASION_KING_MOVE == $evasion_strategy) {
        say "king must move";
    } elsif (CP_EVASION_CAPTURE) {
        say "king can move or piece giving check can be captured";
    } elsif (CP_EVASION_ALL == $evasion_strategy) {
        say "king can move, piece can be captured, or check can be blocked:",
            $pos->dumpBitboard(cp_pos_evasion_squares($pos));
    }

Remember that the item at C<CP_POS_IN_CHECK> gives you a bitboard with all
pieces giving check.  Alternatively, you can use the macro C<cp_pos_in_check>.

The bitboard at C<CP_POS_EVASION_SQUARES> has bits set for all pieces giving
check.

=head2 Various Tricks

=head3 Calculating the Number of Pieces

The locations of pieces are usually represented as bitboards.  You therefore
have to count the number of bits set on the bitboard.  This is conventionally
called a population count or just "popcount".

Example:

    $occupancy = $pos->whitePieces | $pos->blackPieces;
    # or $occupancy = cp_pos_white_pieces($pos) | cp_pos_black_pieces($pos);
    $number_of_pieces = $pos->bitboardPopcount($pos->occupancy);
    # or $number_of_pieces = cp_bitboard_popcount $occupancy;

=head3 Is a Pawn Move a capture?

If the distance between the start and the destination square of a pawn move
is odd, it is a capture.  Keeping in mind that odd numbers (positive and
negative) have the least significant bit set, and even numbers do not, you
can do:

    ($piece, $from, $to) =
        ($pos->movePiece($move), $pos->moveFrom($move), $pos->moveTo($move));
    if ($piece == CP_PAWN && ($from - $to) & 0x1) {
        # Pawn capture.
    }

Alternatively with macros:

    ($piece, $from, $to) =
        (cp_move_piece($move), cp_move_from($move), $cp_move_to($move));
    if ($piece == CP_PAWN && ($from - $to) & 0x1) {
        # En-passant.
    }

=head3 Is a Move an En-Passant Capture?

With or without macros this can be done as follows:

    ($piece, $from, $to) =
        ($pos->movePiece($move), $pos->moveFrom($move), $pos->moveTo($move));
    $ep_shift = $pos->enPassantShift;
    if ($ep_shift && $piece == CP_PAWN
        && ($from - $to) & 0x && $to == $ep_shift) {
        # En-passant.
    }

Alternatively with macros:

    ($piece, $from, $to) =
        (cp_move_piece($move), cp_move_from($move), $cp_move_to($move));
    $ep_shift = cp_pos_en_passant_shift $pos;
    if ($ep_shift && $piece == CP_PAWN
        && ($from - $to) & 0x && $to == $ep_shift) {
        # En-passant.
    }

It is crucial to check that en-passant is actually possible.  Otherwise you
will miss an important edge case.  A black pawn can possibly capture a piece
on "h1".  But the shift of "h1" is 0 and you must therefore check that the
en-passant shift of the current position is not 0.

=head3 Is a Move a Castling?

Castlings are all king moves from "e1" to "c1" or "g1", or on the other side
of the board from "e8" to "c8" or "g8".  But instead of checking all four
cases it is enough to check whether the distance between the start and
destination square is two or minus two.  And that can be done a lot faster:

    ($piece, $from, $to) =
        ($pos->movePiece($move), $pos->moveFrom($move), $pos->moveTo($move));
    if ($piece == CP_KING && ((($from - $to) & 0x3) == 0x2)) {
        # It is a castling.
    }

    # Or with macros:
    ($piece, $from, $to) =
        (cp_move_piece($move), cp_move_from($move), $cp_move_to($move));
    if ($piece == CP_KING && ((($from - $to) & 0x3) == 0x2)) {
        # It is a castling.
    }

=head3 Toggling Color

C<CP_WHITE> is defined as 0 and C<CP_BLACK> is defined as 1.  Therefore,
toggling a color is as easy as:

    $color = !$color; # because CP_WHITE == !CP_BLACK

=head3 Accessing the Bitboard for a Certain Piece

If you want to get the bitboard for a certain kind of piece, you do not have
to compare it against all six possible types.  Remember that an instance
of L<Chess::Position> is an array reference, and the constants
C<CP_PAWN>, C<CP_KNIGHT>, ..., <CP_KING> are chosen so that you can use them
directly as an index into the object itself:

    $piece = CP_ROOK; # or $piece = $pos->movePiece($move);
    $bitboard = $pos->[$piece];

The variable C<$bitboard> now contains the correct bitboard for the piece.

=head3 Accessing Own Pieces and Opponent's Pieces

You will often want that your code works for both black and white.  The
straight-forward way to do this uses a condition:

    if ($pos->toMove == CP_WHITE) {
        $my_pieces = $pos->whitePieces;
        $their_pieces = $pos->blackPieces;
    } else {
        $my_pieces = $pos->whitePieces;
        $their_pieces = $pos->blackPieces;
    }

But the array slots for the white and black pieces are adjacent and this is
guaranteed not to change in the future.  And C<CP_WHITE> is defined as 0
and C<CP_BLACK> as 1.  The above code can therefore be shorted a lot:

    $my_pieces = $pos->[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES + $pos->toMove];
    $their_pieces = $pos->[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES + !$pos->toMove];

Remember that a negated 0 is a 1, and a negated 1 is a 0, see
L</Toggling Color> above.

=head3 Understanding C<rMagic> and C<bMagic>

Both methods are called with two arguments, the shift of the starting square,
and the occupancy of the board.

Imagine that there is a white bishop on "e4", and the other pieces (black and
white) are located as follows (capital letters standing for white pieces,
lowercase letters standing for black pieces):

      a b c d e f g h
    8 r . k . . b . r 8
    7 . p . . . . . . 7
    6 . . n . . n . . 6
    5 . . . . . . . . 5
    4 . . . . B . . . 4
    3 . . . . . . . . 3
    2 . P P . . . . P 2
    1 . . K . . N B R 1
      a b c d e f g h

How can that bishop move? It can reach d3 but not c2 because that is occupied
by a pawn of the same color.  It can reach d5 B<and> c6 because c6 is
occupied by an opponent's piece.  The other squares are f5, g6, h7, f3, and
g2.

But L</bMagic> cannot give you that result directly.  Try it out:

    $fen = 'r1k2b1r/1p6/2n2n2/8/4B3/8/1PP4P/2K2NBR w - - 0 1';
    $pos = Chess::Position->new($fen);
    $targets = $pos->bMagic(CP_E4, $pos->occupancy);
    print $pos->dumpBitboard($targets);

It prints out:

      a b c d e f g h
    8 . . . . . . . . 8
    7 . . . . . . . x 7
    6 . . x . . . x . 6
    5 . . . x . x . . 5
    4 . . . . . . . . 4
    3 . . . x . x . . 3
    2 . . x . . . x . 2
    1 . . . . . . . x 1
      a b c d e f g h

Almost correct but the white pawn on c2 is included which is not possible
because the bishop cannot capture its own pawn.  In order to get the correct
result you have to mask out the pieces of the same color:

    $fen = 'r1k2b1r/1p6/2n2n2/8/4B3/8/1PP4P/2K2NBR w - - 0 1';
    $pos = Chess::Position->new($fen);
    $targets = $pos->bMagic(CP_E4, $pos->occupied)
	    & ~$pos->[CP_POS_WHITE_PIECES + $pos->toMove];
    print $pos->dumpBitboard($targets);

Now the result is correct:

      a b c d e f g h
    8 . . . . . . . . 8
    7 . . . . . . . x 7
    6 . . x . . . x . 6
    5 . . . x . x . . 5
    4 . . . . . . . . 4
    3 . . . x . x . . 3
    2 . . . . . . x . 2
    1 . . . . . . . x 1
      a b c d e f g h
